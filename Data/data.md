#Instructions on how to get the data
-  Go to http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/ft900_index.html
-  Click on the link of the year that you want trade balance data for
-  Click on the "[19|20]XX Annual Revsions" link based on the year you selected. I am using this link because I want to get trade balance for the whole year.
-  Scroll down the page to "Exhibit 13" and click on the link to the text file for the year you wanted. Some of the years have a link to the text file for the year in question and for the previous 2 years. I did not investigate what the difference are between the version of the previous years in that location and the version of the file in that is in the location for that year. I just went to the location for each year to get the file for that year.
-  Download the file and save it to your repository

I plan to automate the downloading of the files but for now it is a manual process.
